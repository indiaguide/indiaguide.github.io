The Kedarnath and Badrinath temples are among the most revered Hindu pilgrimage sites in India, situated in the breathtaking Uttarakhand Himalayas. Kedarnath, dedicated to Lord Shiva, and Badrinath, dedicated to Lord Vishnu, are integral parts of the Char Dham pilgrimage, drawing thousands of devotees each year. This guide is designed to provide essential information for planning your journey, encompassing transportation options, cost estimates, accommodation choices, and valuable tips to enhance your experience. Whether you seek spirituality or adventure, this tour promises to be transformative.
### Getting There: Transportation Options
Embarking on your Kedarnath-Badrinath journey typically begins from Haridwar or Rishikesh, both of which are well-connected by an extensive network of buses and trains. From Haridwar, you can catch buses from the Inter-State Bus Terminal (ISBT) to various destinations, with night travel highly recommended for convenience and efficiency. Your journey will likely involve several legs, such as traveling from Haridwar to Rudraprayag and then onward to Gaurikund, the base for the Kedarnath trek.
If you're starting from Delhi, consider direct bus services to Guptakashi, which can save time. Additionally, shared taxis and sumos are available for hire, offering flexibility in your travel plans. However, it's wise to plan your route in advance to avoid confusion and ensure a smoother experience. The scenic landscapes and winding roads make for an exciting journey, setting the tone for the spiritual adventure that lies ahead.
