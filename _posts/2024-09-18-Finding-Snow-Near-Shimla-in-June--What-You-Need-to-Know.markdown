### The Climate of Shimla in June
June typically marks the beginning of summer in Shimla, with temperatures ranging between 20°C and 29°C (68°F and 84°F). During this month, the days can be warm and pleasant, but evenings often bring cooler breezes, making the climate quite enjoyable for outdoor activities.

In June, rainfall is also common, which can add to the lush green landscapes surrounding Shimla.
